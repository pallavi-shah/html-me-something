              <h3>Posted On:21 oct 2019</h3>
                <p> At a house party, surrounded by public speakers, I was talking to a guy who specializes in 
                    wellness topics. “I got a question for you,” I said to him after sipping a glass of Chardonnay: 
                    “When I'm flying, my legs swell. I drink a lot of water, but I don't want to give up my glass of wine. 
                    What else can I do besides wearing constrictive hose?”</p>
            
                <p> Very excited to share his knowledge with me, the tall guy bent down a bit, and this is what I heard him say: “The next time you fly, 
                    pack a pair of golf balls with you in your carry-on. When you're up in the air, remove your shoes, place the golf balls under your feet,
                    and roll.” He stood back up, and I nodded my head.</p>   

                <p> “Oh, like for circulation, like those Chinese balls you rub in your hands?”</p>
                <p> He nodded in turn, and I moved on to talk to someone else.</p>

                <p>So the next time I flew, I packed a pair of golf balls, and did exactly as he said. 
                   I removed my shoes, and proceeded to position the golf balls under my feet and roll them back and forth. Only it didn't work. 
                   The golf balls kept slipping out from underneath. I lost one as it rolled behind me, and the other as it rolled in front of me.</p>

                   <p>With my seat belt attached, I couldn't reach down far enough--or fast enough-- to catch them. I just watched them roll away. 
                    I began overhearing people say, “Hey, did you see that golf ball?” and “There's a golf ball rolling on the floor!” I kept quiet in my window seat and waited for the balls to roll back to me, which they did. I was able to retrieve them when the “Fasten Your Seat Belt” light went off. Then I packed those little balls away, too embarrassed to try it again.
                </p>
                <p>The next time I saw this speaker, we happened to be waiting for our plane at the airport after a conference. When we had a few minutes to chat, I told him what happened. He looked at me and said: “Did you use a sock?”</p>
                <p>I said, “What?”</p>
                <p>“Did you slip the golf balls into a tube sock?”</p>
                <p>The puzzled look on my face must have been a dead giveaway, and he started to laugh. I started laughing with him, once I realized I'd missed an important part of the instructions.</p>
